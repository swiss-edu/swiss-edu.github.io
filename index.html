<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Switzerland prides itself for being one of the most innovative countries in the world. An important measure of innovation is research output, measured through publication intensity. Switzerland's Referendum vote has created doubts regarding research funding and exchanges coming from the EU, which could affect their position as innovators. In this project, we attempted to assess whether this is a legitimate concern or not.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
 To obtain our results, we used the following databases:
 <ul>
  <li>Thomson Reuters InCites Web of Science Publication Database</li>
  <li>World Bank</li>
  <li>The OECD Databases</li>
</ul>
<h3> Some definitions </h3>
Approach: Analysis of correlations along various parameters. 
<strong>Quantity</strong> is considered to be the total number of (co-)publications in Web of Science Journals in a given time period that meets the criteria. 
<strong>Quality</strong> is considered to be the average Category Normalized Citation Impact of those documents. A value of 1 is considered “world average” in that category. Values > 1 are better, < 1 are worse than the world average.
