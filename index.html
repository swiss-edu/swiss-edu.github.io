<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Switzerland prides itself for being one of the most innovative countries in the world. An important measure of innovation is research output, measured through publication intensity. Switzerland's Referendum vote has created doubts regarding research funding and exchanges coming from the EU, which could affect their position as innovators. In this project, we attempted to assess whether this is a legitimate concern or not.
</p>
 

<h2>Methodology</h2>
To obtain our results, we used the following databases:
 <ul>
  <li>Thomson Reuters InCites Web of Science Publication Database</li>
  <li>World Bank</li>
  <li>The OECD Databases</li>
</ul>

<h3> Some definitions </h3>

Our approach is made of correlations along various parameters:
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Quantity</strong> is considered to be the total number of (co-)publications in Web of Science Journals in a given time period that meets the criteria. 
</li>
  <li><strong>Quality</strong> is considered to be the average Category Normalized Citation Impact of those documents:
   <ul>
    <li>a value of 1 is considered “world average” in that category,</li>
    <li>values greater than 1 are better than the world average,</li>
    <li>values lower than 1 are worse than the world average.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to this data, we could answer to a few question related to Swiss academic performance.</p>

<h2>How is Switzerland international collaboration impacted by the referendum?</h2>
<div><iframe width="900" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~Merinorus/159.embed"></iframe></div>
<p>The international collaboration represents the ratio of Web of Science papers that have, at least, one international collaborator. <br/>
On this graph, Switzerland seems to evolves at the same pace as Europe (15 first countries, as Europe was until 2004) and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development'>OCDE</a>. <br/>
We can display the impact evolution of Switzerland compared to the 15 first European countries, so we get a better idea about the comparison:
</p>
<div><iframe width="900" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~Merinorus/163.embed"></iframe></div>
<p>Now this is interesting! It seems like Switzerland has less and less papers papers with international collaboration comparing to Europe (based on the all the published papers).
We can see a constant decrease from 2009, and it get worse from 2012 (the law was proposed in february, 2012), even worse in 2013. Remind the law has been accepted in february, 2014.
But is that enough to say the referendum decision led to this evolution? From our data, We can observe a similar behavior at the end of the 1990's, and the Switzerland's performance was kept quite stable from 2000 to 2010.
</p>
<p>
This is not possible to correlate with confidence the data we present here with only one political decision. Plus, it is maybe a bit too early to claim any conclusion.<br />
Indeed, most of the financial help Switzerland is not getting anymore from Europe: (about 80 millions francs a year, eg: Erasmus program, among other things) is mostly compensated with the help of the Swiss National Science Foundation. If it's not compensated anymore, we might expect an impact evolution in the medium term.<br />
</p>
<p>
The Swiss immigration referendum may also involves more complicated procedures to work in the Swiss academic organization. For instance, a foreign student (European of not) will face more administrative procedures and obstacles to study in Switzerland. This might lead to less incoming (and thus, outcoming) exchange students, then potentially less foreign PhD candidates, less international publications and so on. <br />
Anyway, the impact should be progressive, not immediate, and this is probably way too early to measure the consequences.
