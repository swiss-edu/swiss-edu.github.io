<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Switzerland prides itself for being one of the most innovative countries in the world. An important measure of innovation is research output, measured through publication intensity. Switzerland's Referendum vote has created doubts regarding research funding and exchanges coming from the EU, which could affect their position as innovators. In this project, we attempted to assess whether this is a legitimate concern or not.
